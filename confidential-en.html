    <h1>Why Do We Use the Microphone?</h1>
    <p>The <strong>Binaural Sounds Generator</strong> app uses microphone access (<code>RECORD_AUDIO</code>) to allow you to record ambient noises from your environment. This feature helps generate a personalized white noise tailored to your relaxation or focus needs.</p>
    <p><strong>How it works:</strong> During a 2-second recording, captured sounds are analyzed locally to determine a dominant frequency. This frequency is then used to create a sound that effectively masks surrounding noises. No data is stored, transmitted, or shared with third parties.</p>
    <p><strong>Your control:</strong> You can deny this permission in your device settings at any time. If you choose not to grant it, the app will continue to function with predefined frequencies.</p>
